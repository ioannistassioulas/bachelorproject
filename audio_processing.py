# Purpose: this code seeks to transform a .wav file into an array of datapoints that can be plotted into a waves
# Upon accomplishing this, the code will export the datapoints to other parts of the project for the purpose of
# generating spikes

# This is done through multiple difference ways

# To DO:
# 1. upload all used data files into GitHub, such that code is consistent between both locations
# 2. consider including a library file into the project such that I don't need to keep importing from here
